Thomas Adika 
 
Hello! I am a student at Daystar University (based in kenya), and I am passionate about Linux OS and writing bash scripts for installation processes. I have experience setting up nginx web servers and python environments, and I am familiar with the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am an object-oriented programmer and I am always looking to learn new skills and technologies.

My GitHub profile showcases some of the projects I have worked on, including bash scripts for installing software, scripts for automating tasks, and other programming projects. Feel free to take a look around and get in touch if you have any questions or comments.
